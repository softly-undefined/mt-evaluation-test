For China, after its experience in various disputes in the previous phase, perhaps there are certain issues that are worth the attention. Firstly, to have a correct perception of the level of difficulty for the smoothening of relationship between China and the rest of world. Secondly, to have a correct perception of how much China can achieve currently. Thirdly, to have a correct perception, adjustment and control over the changes of mindset of China in the midst of high speed development.	For China, there may be some focuses worth further attention after various upsets in the previous stage: first, to rightly understand the running-in difficulty between China and the world; second, to rightly recognize what China can do at present; and third, to rightly be aware of the change of the Chinese mindset during the period when China is in fast growth, make proper adjustment and take good control of it.

In these few issues, what we meant by having a correct perception of the level of difficulty for the smoothening of relationship between China and the rest of world means that the integration of China with the world was not a change due to China's own  intention, but due to the subtle smoothening of relationship with the international world in terms of mindset, values and rules of the game.	Of the above focuses, the so-called "to rightly understand the running-in difficulty between China and the world" means that China's integration into the world does not rely on China's own sincerity, and it involves in the subtle running-in with the international community in such aspects as the mind, value view and game rules.

This would be conducive for China's interaction with the international community both pre- and post-Olympics.	To have a correct perception of the how much China can achieve means that China should consider its current phase of development and not to avoid facing its existing problems nor making promises which it cannot fulfill, but to face the world with sincerity, transparency and truthfulness. This will be beneficial to its interaction with the international communities, whether it is pre-olympics or post-olympics era.	"To rightly recognize what China can do at present" means that China should not slide over its own problems, not promise what it cannot do and show itself in a manner of honesty, transparency and truthfulness on the basis of its current development stage.
